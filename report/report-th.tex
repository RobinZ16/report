\section{Theoretical results}
\label{sec:th}

We want to extend the results from the previous section by lifting the
base field from the rational field $\Q$ to quadratic number fields,
i.e., raising the degree $D$ in the Uniform Boundedness Conjecture
statement from 1 to 2.

% I use \mathcal{U} to denote our "universe".
Let $\U$ be the collection of all rational or quadratic elements in
$\ol{\Q}$,%
\footnote{This is a bad set with very little structure. We only refer
  to it to simplify our statements.}  i.e.,
\[
\U = \set{\alpha \in \ol{\Q}: \text{$a \alpha^2 + b \alpha + c = 0$
    for some $a, b, c \in \Q$}},
\]
or equivalently,
\[
\U = \bigcup_{[K : \Q] = 2}K,
\]
where the union is the union of sets, taken over all quadratic number
fields.

We pose the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item For a given $N$, how many $c \in \U$ are there such that
  $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ has a periodic point in $\U$ of exact period
  $N$?

\item For a given $N$, if the answer to (i) is infinite, then what if
  we restrict $c$ to being rational? That is, how many $c \in \Q$ are
  there such that $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ has a periodic point in $\U$
  of exact period $N$?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
  In the questions above, we only asked for the number of
  $c$. However, once $c$ is known, we can immediately determine all
  the periodic points of exact period $N$ from the equation $\Phi_N(z,
  c) = 0$; and the number of such points is bound above by
  \[
  \deg_z \Phi_N(z, c) = \sum_{d|N}2^d \mu(N/d),
  \]
  which is a constant only depending on $N$. Moreover,
  in some cases we can obtain a much sharper bound.
\end{remark}

It turns out that we can fully answer Questions~(i) and (ii) for $N =
4$, and partially answer them for $N = 5$. For $N = 4$, the answer to
both questions are infinite, and we have an explicit parametrization
of $c$ for Question~(ii). For $N = 5$, the answer to Question~(i) is
finite, but at the time of writing we do not have a concrete bound. We
conjecture that the answer is in fact zero.

The results highlighted above are presented below in detail with
proof.

\subsection{The $N = 4$ case}

In 1998, Morton proved a useful parametrization of all 4-cycles for
$\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$.

\begin{theorem} [Morton, Proposition~2 in \cite{MR1665198}]
	For $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$, $c$ and the points of exact period 4
	can be parametrized over $\Q$ by the following:
	\[
	\begin{gathered}
		c = \frac{1 - 4t^3 - t^6}{4t^2(t^2 - 1)}, \\
		x_1 = \frac{t^4 - t^2 + \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{2t(t^2 - 1)},
		x_2	= \frac{1 - t^2 + t \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{4t^2(t^2 - 1)}, \\
		x_3 = \frac{t^4 - t^2 - \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{2t(t^2 - 1)},
		x_4 = \frac{1 - t^2 - t \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{4t^2(t^2 - 1)}, \\
	\end{gathered}
	\]
	where $t = x_1 + x_3$.
\end{theorem}

If we allow $t$ to vary over $\Z$ or $\Q$, then it follows that:

\begin{corollary}
	There are infinitely many $c$ in $\Q$ with points in quadratic
	fields of exact period 4 for $\phi_c(z)$.
\end{corollary}

Furthermore, we can specify how many such points exist for each $c
\in \Q$ by considering the possible degrees of factors of $\Phi_4(
x,c)$. Substitution of $c = \frac{1 - 4t^3 - t^6}{4t^2(t^2 - 1)}$
into $\Phi_4(x,c)$ and polynomial factorization yields:

\begin{lemma}
	For $c$ such that $\phi$ has 4-cycles over quadratic fields,
	the degree 12 polynomial $\Phi_4(x,c)$ must factor as $\{2,2,8\}$
	(list of degrees of factors, with the 8th degree factor not
	necessarily irreducible).
\end{lemma}

We already know that $\Phi_4(x_c)$ cannot factor as $\{2,2,2,2,4\}$
by Panraksa (Theorem~2.3.5 in \cite{MR2982105}). Therefore, we
obtain the following result:

\begin{theorem}
  For each $c \in \Q$, there is at most one 4-cycle with points
	defined over quadratic fields.
\end{theorem}

%%%TO DO
Also, it is worth pointing to the distribution of $d$ (as in
$\Q(\sqrt{d})$), briefly presented in the comp section.
