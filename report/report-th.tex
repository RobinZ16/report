\section{Theoretical results}
\label{sec:th}

We want to extend the results from the previous section by lifting the
base field from the rational field $\Q$ to quadratic number fields,
i.e., raising the degree $D$ in the Uniform Boundedness Conjecture
statement from 1 to 2.

Let $\U$ be the collection of all rational or quadratic elements in
$\ol{\Q}$,\footnote{%
  $\U$ is a bad set with very little structure. We only refer to it to
  simplify our statements.}  i.e.,
\[
\U = \set{\alpha \in \ol{\Q}: \text{$a \alpha^2 + b \alpha + c = 0$
    for some $a, b, c \in \Q$}},
\]
or equivalently,
\[
\U = \bigcup_{[K : \Q] = 2}K,
\]
where the union is the union of sets, taken over all quadratic number
fields.

We pose the following question:

\begin{question}
  \label{question}
  How many $c \in \Q$ are there such that $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ has
  periodic points in $\U$ of exact period $N$?
\end{question}

\begin{remark}
  In the above question, we only asked for the number of $c$. However,
  once $c$ is known, we can immediately determine all the periodic
  points of exact period $N$ from the equation $\Phi_N(z, c) = 0$; and
  the number of such points is bound above by
  \[
  \deg_z \Phi_N(z, c) = \sum_{d|N}2^d \mu(N/d),
  \]
  which is a constant only depending on $N$. Moreover,
  in some cases we can obtain a much sharper bound; see, for instance,
  Subsection~\ref{subsec:quadratic-4}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  We are not strictly increasing $D$ to 2, since we are still
  requiring $c \in \Q$.

  The rationale is that, for $N = 4$, the problem becomes easy once
  we also allow $c$ to be quadratic; in fact, Corollary~5.11 in
  \cite{2013arXiv1308.3267B} tells us that the number of quadratic
  points on $X_1(16)$ is infinite (recall that $C_1(4)$ is
  birationally equivalent to $X_1(16)$; see
  Subsection~\ref{subsec:model-4}).

  For $N = 5$, the problem might be harder if we allow $c$ to be
  quadratic, since the curve at hand given by (\ref{eq:c0(5)}) is not
  so special as the $N = 4$ case, and it is generally much harder to
  find quadratic points on curves than to find rational ones (which is
  already highly nontrivial). We did not put much thought into this
  case, so we have little to report on this front.
\end{remark}

It turns out that we can fully answer Questions~\ref{question} for
$N = 4$, and partially answer it for $N = 5$.

For $N = 4$, the answer is infinite, since an explicit parametrization
of $c$ is available to us. The details can be found in
Subsection~\ref{subsec:quadratic-4}.

For $N = 5$, the answer is finite, but at the time of writing we
do not have a concrete bound. We conjecture that the answer is in fact
zero. The details can be found in Subsection~\ref{subsec:quadratic-5}.

Furthermore, when we were studying the proofs that led up to the
conclusion of the $N = 4$ case, we found an interesting lemma that can
be made to work, under certain limitations, for any $N$. This result
is potentially useful for investigating Question~\ref{question} in the
general case, so we document it with proof in
Subsection~\ref{subsec:general}.

\subsection{The quadratic $N = 4$ case}
\label{subsec:quadratic-4}

The study of points with exact period 4 for $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ is
made easy by a parametrization of all 4-cycles that immediately
follows from Morton's work in \cite{MR1665198}.

\begin{proposition}
  For $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$, all combinations of $c$ and a
  corresponding 4-cycle $\set{z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4}$ of $\phi_c(z)$ can
  be parametrized over $\C$ by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:4-param}
    \begin{gathered}
      c = \frac{1 - 4t^3 - t^6}{4t^2(t^2 - 1)}, \\
      z_1 = \frac{t^4 - t^2 + \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{2t(t^2 -
        1)},\,
      z_2 = \frac{1 - t^2 + t \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{4t^2(t^2
        - 1)}, \\
      z_3 = \frac{t^4 - t^2 - \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{2t(t^2 -
        1)},\,
      z_4 = \frac{1 - t^2 - t \sqrt{(t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)}}{4t^2(t^2
        - 1)},
    \end{gathered}
  \end{equation}
  where $t = z_1 + z_3$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
  Notice the ``parametrized over $\C$'' in the statement. This is just
  an algebraic result that works universally.
\end{remark}

Furthermore, assuming that $c \in \Q$ and $\set{z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4}
\subset K$ for some quadratic number field $K$, Panraksa demonstrated
that $t = z_1 + z_3$ must be rational (Theorem~1.5.1 in
\cite{MR2982105}), so in fact

\begin{theorem} [Panraksa, Theorem~1.5.2 in \cite{MR2982105}]
  All combinations of $c \in \Q$ and a corresponding 4-cycle
  $\set{z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4} \subset K$ for some quadratic number field
  $K$ are given by ranging $t$ over $\Q$ in the parametrization
  (\ref{eq:4-param}).
\end{theorem}

Notice that for any $c \in \Q$ and $z \in \U$ a periodic point of
$\phi_c$ with exact period 4, the orbit to which $z$ belongs, $\set{z,
  \phi_c(z), \phi_c^2(z), \phi_c^3(z)}$, lies in the same quadratic
number field as $z$. Therefore, the theorem above gives us complete
information for what we asked about in Question~\ref{question}. In
particular, allowing $t$ to range over $\Q$, Question~\ref{question}
is immediately answered by

\begin{corollary}
  There are infinitely many $c$ in $\Q$ such that $\phi_c(z) = z^2 +
  c$ has periodic points in $\U$ of exact period 4. Moreover, all such
  $c$ are given by
  \[
  c = \frac{1 - 4t^3 - t^6}{4t^2(t^2 - 1)},
  \]
  where $t$ is any rational number other than $0$ and $\pm 1$.
\end{corollary}

Furthermore, we can specify how many quadratic periodic points of
exact period 4 exist for each such $c \in \Q$. Recall that Panraksa
showed that for a 4-cycle $\set{z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4} \subset \U$, $z_1
+ z_3$ must be rational (i.e., $z_1$ and $z_3$ must be of the form $a
\pm b \sqrt{d}$ for some $a, b, d \in \Q$), and similarly for $z_2$
and $z_4$. Therefore, $(z - z_1)(z - z_3) \in \Q[z]$ and $(z - z_2)(z
- z_4) \in \Q[Z]$, and hence each 4-cycle in $\U$ shows up as two
quadratic factors (not necessarily irreducible) in the factorization
of $\Phi_4(z, c)$ in $\Q[z]$. We can get a hold on the number of
4-cycles (and consequently the number of 4-periodic points) by
studying the number of quadratic factors in the factorization of
$\Phi_4(z, c)$ in $\Q[z]$. This was also partially done by Panraksa,
who showed that (Theorem~2.3.5 in \cite{MR2982105}) for any $c \in
\Q$, $\Phi_4(z, c)$ cannot factor as $\set{2, 2, 2, 2, 4}$ over $\Q$
(list of degrees of factors, not necessarily irreducible). Therefore,
we obtain the following result:

\begin{theorem}
  For each $c \in \Q$, $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ has at most one 4-cycle
  with points in $\U$, i.e., with points defined over a quadratic
  number field. Consequently, for each $c \in \Q$, $\phi_c(z) = z^2 +
  c$ has at most four periodic points in $\U$ of exact period 4.
\end{theorem}

Subsequently, we sought to understand precisely which quadratic fields
could contain the 4-cycles. Due to the precise parametrization
(\ref{eq:4-param}), this problem reduces to finding rational numbers
of the form $d = (t^4 - 1)(t^2 + 2t - 1)$, with $t \in \Q$, up to
rational squares. Further discussion of this problem can be found in
Subsection.

\subsection{The quadratic $N = 5$ case}
\label{subsec:quadratic-5}

Let us recall from (\ref{eq:c0(5)}) and (\ref{eq:c-in-xy}) that $y^2 =
f(x)$ and $c = (P_0(x) + P_1(x) y)/h(x)$, so eliminating $y$ we have
\[
(c \cdot h(x) - P_0(x))^2 = P_1(x)^2 y^2 = P_1(x)^2 f(x),
\]
i.e., $x$ satisfies the polynomial equation
\[
[(c \cdot h - P_0)^2 - P_1^2 f](x) = 0.
\]
Since we are only looking for $x \in \U$,\footnote{%
  Recall that we are looking for $z \in \U$ and $c \in \Q$. On $C_0(5)
  = C_1(5) / \tup{\sigma}$, whose points correspond to pairs $(\O,
  \phi_c)$, each orbit $\O$ is represented by its trace $\tau = z +
  \phi_c(z) + \cdots + \phi_c^4(z)$, which is in the same quadratic
  extension as $z$. The series of change of coordinates from $(\tau,
  c)$ to $(x, y)$ involves only arithmetic operations, so the
  resulting $x$ and $y$ are still in the same quadratic extension as
  $\tau$. In particular, we have $x \in \U$. See \cite{MR1480542} for
  details.}
there exist some rational coefficients $a$ and $b$ such that $x$
solves the quadratic equation
\[
x^2 + a x + b = 0.
\]
We have obtained two polynomial equations in $x$, so we may divide
$[(c \cdot h - P_0)^2 - P_1^2 f]$ by $x^2 + ax + b$ using long
division, and the remainder must be zero. Since $x^2 + ax + b$ is
quadratic in $x$, the remainder is linear, in the form
\[
\l_1(a, b, c) x + \l_0(a, b, c),
\]
where $\l_1$ and $\l_0$ are polynomials in $a$, $b$, and $c$ given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
  \l_1&(a, b, c) = - 4a^5c - 8a^5 + 40a^4c + 74a^4 + 16a^3bc + 32a^3b
  - 16a^3c^2 - \\

  12ab^2c - \\
  & 24ab^2 + 32abc^2 + 368abc + 542ab - 144ac^2 - 380ac - 325a + 40b^2c + \\
  & 74b^2 - 96bc^2 - 416bc - 452b + 96c + 110,
\end{aligned}
\]
and
\[
\begin{aligned}
  \l_0&(a, b, c) = - 4a^4bc - 8a^4b + 40a^3bc + 74a^3b + 12a^2b^2c +
  24a^2b^2 - 16a^2bc^2 - \\
  & 184a^2bc - 271a^2b - 80ab^2c - 148ab^2 + 96abc^2 +
  416abc + 452ab - 4b^3c - \\
  & 8b^3 + 16b^2c^2 + 184b^2c + 271b^2 - 144bc^2 - 380bc -
  325b + 36c + 64.
\end{aligned}
\]
Note that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all rational, so $\l_1(a, b, c)$ and
$\l_0(a, b, c)$ are rational, and hence from
\[
\l_1(a, b, c) x + \l_0(a, b, c) = 0
\]
we conclude that either $x$ is rational, or both $\l_1$ and $\l_0$ are
zero. Thanks to \cite{MR1480542}, we already fully understand the case
where $x$ is rational (in which case there are no corresponding
periodic points even in $\U$ --- they are either at infinity or
defined only in a quintic extension of $\Q$). Therefore, here we
consider $x \in \U \setminus \Q$, and hence
\[
\l_1(a, b, c) = \l_0(a, b, c) = 0.
\]

Notice that $c$ is a common root to $\l_1$ and $\l_0$, so by
Proposition~\ref{res}, we have
\[
\res_c(\l_1(a, b, c), \l_2(a, b, c)) = 0.
\]

Now we have three cases.

\begin{case}
  The leading coefficient of $\l_1(a, b, c)$, considered as a
  polynomial in $c$, vanishes. This happens when
  \[
  -16(a - 3)(a(a-3) - 2b) = 0,
  \]
  i.e., either $a = 3$, or $b = a(a-3)/2$, or both.

  If $a = 3$, plugging into $\l_1 = \l_2 = 0$ we get two polynomial
  equations in $b$ and $c$. Taking the resultant of the two with
  respect to $c$, we get $- 96b^7 - 1264b^5 - 4256b^5 + 32b^4 +
  13248b^3 + 37632b^2 + 92160b = 0$, which has only one rational root
  $b = 0$. However, $\l_1(3, 0, c) \equiv -64 \ne 0$, so there is no
  rational solution in this case.

  If $b = a(a-3)/2$, plugging into $\l_1 = \l_2 = 0$ we get two
  polynomials equations in $a$ and $c$. Again using the resultant we
  can show that there is no rational solution in this case. See the
  attached Mathematica notebook \texttt{mma/abc.nb} for details.
\end{case}

\begin{case}
  The leading coefficient of $\l_0(a, b, c)$, considered as a
  polynomial in $c$, vanishes. This happens when
  \[
  -16b(b - (a-3)^2) = 0,
  \]
  i.e., either $b = 0$ or $b = (a - 3)^2$. Similar to Case~1, we can
  easily show that there is no rational solution in this case. See
  \texttt{mma/abc.nb} for details.
\end{case}

\begin{case}
  Both of the leading coefficients of $\l_1(a, b, c)$ and $\l_0(a, b,
  c)$, considered as a polynomial in $c$, are non-vanishing, i.e.,
  both $\l_1(a, b, c)$ and $\l_0(a, b, c)$ are quadratic in
  $c$. Therefore, by Proposition~\ref{res}, $\res_c(\l_1(a, b, c),
  \l_0(a, b, c))$ is given by a polynomial in the six coefficients
  (three in $\l_1$ and three in $\l_0$). Mathematica is capable of
  computing this polynomial, and when we plug in the six coefficients,
  we have
  \[
  \res_c(\l_1(a, b, c), \l_0(a, b, c)) = P(a, b)
  \]
  for some polynomial $P(a, b) \in \Z[a, b]$.
\end{case}

\subsection{General results}
\label{subsec:general}

While studying the quadratic N = 4 case, we tried to mimic results
to the quadratic N = 6 case. In particular, the following result by
Panraksa is quite important in demonstrating that, for points of exact
period 4 in quadratic number fields $x_i$, the trace $t = \sum\limits_
{i=1}^4 x_i$ is rational.

\begin{theorem} [Panraksa, Lemma~2.3.1 in \cite{MR2982105}]
	Let $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$ be an exact 4-cycle defined in some
	quadratic number field $K$ for $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ with $c \in \Q$.
	If $x_3 \neq \overline{x_1}$, then $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\} \cap
	\{\overline{x_1}, \overline{x_2}, \overline{x_3}, \overline{x_4}\}
	= \emptyset$.
\end{theorem}

Panraksa then proves that $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\} \cap
\{\overline{x_1}, \overline{x_2}, \overline{x_3}, \overline{x_4}\}
= \emptyset$ is impossible to get his final result. We managed to prove
a much more general version of his lemma:

\begin{theorem}
	Let $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ with $c \in \Q$. Let $\{x_1, \ldots, x_{N}\}$ be
	an exact $N$-cycle defined over a Galois number field K, with N
	divisible by	$d = [K:\Q ]$. Then either: \\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $x_{\frac{iN}{d}+1} = \sigma(x_1)$ for some nontrivial $\sigma \in
	\gal(K/\Q)$, $i \in \Z$
	\item $\{x_1, \ldots, x_{N}\} \cap \{\tau(x_1), \ldots, \tau(x_{N})\} =
	\emptyset$, $\forall \tau \in \gal(K/\Q)$ nontrivial.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Note that $\{\tau(x_1), \ldots, \tau(x_{N})\}$ for any $\tau \in
	\gal(K/\Q)$ is a cycle of $\phi_c$ because $c \in \Q$. Assume
	that neither case is true. Then $x_{\frac{N}{d}+1} \neq \sigma(
	x_1)$ $\forall \sigma \in \gal(K/\Q)$ and $\{x_1, \ldots, x_{N}\}
	\cap \{\tau(x_1), \ldots, \tau(x_{N})\} \neq \emptyset$ $\forall
	\tau \in \gal(K/\Q)$. Then $\exists x_j \in \{x_1, \ldots, x_{N}\}
	\cap \{\tau(x_1), \ldots, \tau(x_{N})\}$ for some $\tau \in \gal(K/
	\Q)$. Applying $\phi$ an appropriate number of times allows us to
	renumerate the cycle	such that $x_1$ is in the intersection.
	Thus, $x_k = \tau(x_1)$ for some $1 \leq k \leq N$ and therefore $
	\tau \equiv \phi^{k-1}$ on the N-cycle (because Galois conjugation
	commutes with $\phi$). Since $K$ is Galois, $\tau^d = Id$ and so:
	\[
		x_d = \tau^d(x_d) = \phi^{dk-d}(x_d) = x_{dk}
	\]
	Notice that the application of $\phi^{N-(d-1)}$ yields $x_1 =
	x_{dk-(d-1)} = x_{d(k-1) + 1}$. Notice that this produces a
	contradiction if $d(k-1) + 1 \not\equiv 1$ (modulo $N$): if $l$
	is the representative of $d(k-1) + 1$ modulo N, then $\{x_1, \ldots
	, x_l\}$ gives an $l$-cycle with $l < N$. Thus, it must be that
	$d(k-1) + 1 \equiv 1$ (modulo $N$). The only such $k$ are given
	by $k = \frac{lN}{d} + 1$ for some $l \in \Z$, so $x_{\frac{lN}{d}
	+ 1} = x_k = \tau(x_1)$.	However, we already have that
	$x_{\frac{iN}{d}+1} \neq \sigma(x_1)$ $\forall \sigma \in \gal(K/\Q)$,
	$i \in \Z$. This gives a contradiction.
\end{proof}

In fact, we strongly believe that the second case never occurs in general.
Although we do not have much data, all of the examples that we have found
satisfy the first case (e.g. all 4-cycles, the 5-cycles described by
Flynn-Poonen-Schaefer \cite{MR1480542}, and the 6-cycles described by
Stoll \cite{MR2465796}). If this is true in general, then it follows that
all periodic points for $\phi_c$ (with $c$ rational) in Galois number fields
with degree divisible by their period produce rational points in $C_0(N)$
since the first case produces rational trace $t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N x_i$.
So in general, we conjecture that:

\begin{conjecture}
	Let $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ with $c \in \Q$. Let $\{x_1, \ldots, x_{N}\}$ be
	an exact $N$-cycle defined over a Galois number field K, with N
	divisible by	$d = [K:\Q ]$. Then $x_{\frac{iN}{d}+1} = \sigma(x_1)$
	for some nontrivial $\sigma \in \gal(K/\Q)$, $i \in \Z$ and therefore the
	$x_i$'s produce rational points on $C_0(N)$.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{remark}
	If this conjecture were true, one tangible consequence is that the
	6-cycle over $\Q(\sqrt{33})$ with $c = -\frac{71}{48}$ and $x_1 = -1 +
	\frac{\sqrt{33}}{12}$ found by Stoll \cite{MR2465796} is the only 6-cycle
	defined over a quadratic number field (conditionally on the weak form of
	BSD). Since the only results on rational points of $C_0(N)$ currently are
	those of Morton \cite{MR1665198} for $N = 4$, Flynn-Poonen-Schaefer
	\cite{MR1480542} for $N = 5$, and Stoll \cite{MR2465796} for $N = 6$
	(conditionally on the weak form of BSD), we have to wait for other results
	on $C_0(N)$ for other $N$ to see if this conjecture might imply results for
	other numerical cases.
