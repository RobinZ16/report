Niccol\`o suggested that we make use of the hyperelliptic curve
\[
\mathcal{C}: y^2 = x^6 + 8x^5 + 22x^4 + 22x^3 + 5x^2 + 6x + 1,
\]
which is birationally equivalent to $C_0(5)$ (FPS p.5). $c$ is given
in terms of $(x, y)$ on $\mathcal{C}$ by
\[
c = \frac{P_0(x) + P_1(x) y}{8x^2(3+x)^2},
\]
where
\[
\begin{gathered}
  P_0(x) = -9 - 24x - 95x^2 - 104x^3 - 46x^4 - 10x^5 - x^6,\\
  P_1(x) = -9 + 3x + 6x^2 + x^3.
\end{gathered}
\]

Niccol\`o suggested that maybe it is possible to use software to find
all $K$ points on $\mathcal{C}$, given a specific $K =
\Q(\sqrt{d})$. Then we can compute $c$ from these points, and then by
a miracle, we might find some rational $c$.

Using this method, we will be enumerating over $d$, which are
squarefree integers; and looking for $K$ points on a
not-too-horrible curve $\mathcal{C}$. It might be faster than brute
forcing all rational $c$.
