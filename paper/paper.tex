\begin{abstract}
  We focus on a very specific case of the Uniform Boundedness
  Conjecture, namely, bounding the number of possible $c$ such that
  the quadratic polynomial $\phi_c(z) = z^2 + c$ has quadratic
  periodic points of some small period. We show that there are
  infinitely many rational $c$ with quadratic 4-cycles, with all such
  $c$ completely understood; and only finitely many rational $c$ with
  quadratic 5-cycles (we conjecture that there are none). We also
  present a general theorem, together with a more powerful conjecture,
  that may be useful for reducing the search of quadratic cycles (or
  higher) to that of rational cycles. Computational data have been
  produced to support our conjectures.
