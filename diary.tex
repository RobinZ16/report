\section{6-Cycles in Quadratic Fields}

\begin{conjecture}[Galois Conjugacy]
	\label{conj:gc}
	Let $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\}$ be a $6$-cycle over a 
	quadratic field $K$. Then 
	$x_4 = \overline{x_1}, x_5 = \overline{x_2}, x_6 = \overline{x_3}$
\end{conjecture}

\begin{corollary}[Conditional Classification of 6-Cycles over Quadratic Fields]
	Conjecture \ref{conj:gc} and the weak BSD Conjecture, imply that the only 6-cycle over quadratic fields is in $K = \Q(\sqrt{33})$ and is given by:
	\[
		\phi(x) = x^2 - \frac{71}{48}, x_1 = -1 + \frac{\sqrt{33}}{12}
	\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\}$ be a $6$-cycle over a 
	quadratic field $K$ and define $t = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6$
	to be the trace of the orbit. By Conjecture \ref{conj:gc}, 
	$x_4 = \overline{x_1}, x_5 = \overline{x_2}, x_6 = \overline{x_3}$. Thus, we have
	\[
		t = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \overline{x_1} + \overline{x_2} + \overline{x_3} \in \Q
	\]
	Therefore, each 6-cycle can be represented as a $\Q$-point on $C_0(6)(\Q)$ via its trace. 
	Using Stoll's characterization of the $\Q$-points of $C_1(6)$(cite), 
	we know that the 6-cycle given by $K = \Q(\sqrt{33}), \phi(x) = x^2 - \frac{71}{48}, x_1 = -1 + \frac{\sqrt{33}}{12}$
	is the only 6-cycle over a quadratic field and not over $\Q$.
	Stoll finds, using a proof conditional on the weak BSD Conjecture, that there are no 6-cycles over $\Q$ either.
\end{proof}
